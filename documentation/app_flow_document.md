### **Introduction**  
The SaaS platform is now a **dynamic AI rehearsal studio**, where actors practice with a virtual partner that *adapts to their emotions, pacing, and collaborative needs*. Key enhancements:  
- **Emotion-Driven Interactions**: AI reads lines with sarcasm, anger, or hesitation based on script cues.  
- **Adaptive Timing**: Adjusts pauses/speed in real-time if users stumble or rush.  
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Rehearse scenes with remote partners, syncing edits and feedback instantly.

### **Onboarding & Sign-In/Sign-Up**  
1. **Emotion Preferences**:  
   - Users set default AI tone (e.g., "neutral," "intense") during sign-up.  
   - Enable **offline mode** for speech recognition (Whisper Tiny).  
2. **Permissions**:  
   - Grant microphone access for real-time practice.  
   - Opt into **collaboration alerts** for group rehearsals.

### **Detailed Feature Flows**  

#### **1. Script Upload & AI Analysis**  
- **Drag & Drop**: PDF/Word ‚Üí Auto-tag emotions (DeepSeek) and suggest pacing (e.g., *[pause: 0.5s]*).

|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Line-by-Line**   | AI highlights emotional cues (e.g., *[angrily]*) and replays lines with modulation. |
