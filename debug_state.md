# Debugging State

## Current Issues

1. `ResizeObserver` not defined in test environment

   - Affects: Scene navigation component tests
   - Location: `src/components/scripts/__tests__/scene-navigation.test.tsx`
   - Status: In Progress
   - Root Cause: JSDOM test environment doesn't include ResizeObserver

2. React `act()` warnings

   - Affects: Radix UI components (ScrollArea, Presence)
   - Status: Pending
   - Related to: State updates during testing

3. Scene Navigation Test Failures
   - Issue: `aria-pressed` attribute test failing
   - Expected: "true" for current scene
   - Received: "false"
   - Status: In Progress

## Progress Made

1. Added ResizeObserver mock in test setup
2. Updated button name patterns in tests
3. Added proper duration formatting
4. Attempted to fix aria-pressed attribute handling

## Next Steps

1. Verify ResizeObserver mock implementation
2. Address remaining aria-pressed attribute issues
3. Fix React act() warnings
4. Update test assertions to match component behavior

## File Changes Made

- Modified: `src/components/scripts/__tests__/scene-navigation.test.tsx`
  - Added ResizeObserver mock
  - Updated button name patterns
  - Modified test assertions

## Environment Details

- OS: darwin 24.1.0
- Workspace: /Users/Peter/OFFbookv2
- Shell: /bin/zsh

## Test Command

```bash
jest scene-navigation.test.tsx
```

## Current Test Output

- Exit Code: 1
- Failures:
  1. Scene navigation renders all scenes
     - Expected aria-pressed="true"
     - Received aria-pressed="false"
  2. Scene navigation highlights current scene
     - Similar aria-pressed attribute mismatch
