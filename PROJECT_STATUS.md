# OFFbook Project Status Report
Date: January 29, 2025

## Current State

### Database Configuration
- Using SQLAlchemy 2.0 with async support
- PostgreSQL database backend
- Connection pool settings:
  - Pool size: 10
  - Max overflow: 3
  - Pool recycle: 1800s
  - Pool pre-ping: Enabled
  - Pool timeout: 20.0s

### Active Issues

1. **SQLAlchemy Import Error**
   - Error: `ImportError: cannot import name 'JSONB' from 'sqlalchemy'`
   - Location: `src/database/models.py`
   - Impact: Application startup failure
   - Required Fix: Update SQLAlchemy imports to use correct JSON type

2. **Server Port Conflict**
   - Error: `[Errno 48] Address already in use`
   - Impact: Unable to start server on port 8002
   - Required Fix: Kill existing process or use different port

3. **Resource Leakage Warning**
   - Warning: `12 leaked semaphore objects to clean up at shutdown`
   - Impact: Potential resource management issues
   - Required Fix: Proper cleanup of multiprocessing resources

### Recent Changes

1. **Backup System Implementation**
   - Added comprehensive backup manager (`src/utils/backup_manager.py`)
   - Implemented CLI interface for backup operations
   - Created automated backup scheduling
   - First backup created successfully with 1432 files

2. **Database Connection Pooling**
   - Implemented async connection pool
   - Added health monitoring
   - Pool statistics tracking and reporting

### Next Steps

1. **Critical Fixes**
   - Fix JSONB import issue in models.py
   - Resolve port conflict for development server
   - Address semaphore leakage

2. **Improvements**
   - Implement automated testing for backup system
   - Add backup rotation policy
   - Create backup verification system

3. **Documentation**
   - Update API documentation
   - Document backup procedures
   - Create development setup guide

## Notes

1. The application is currently experiencing startup issues due to SQLAlchemy configuration problems.
2. Database operations are working but need optimization.
3. Backup system is operational and successfully created first backup.
4. Server deployment needs attention due to port conflicts.

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Fix SQLAlchemy JSONB import by updating to correct import statement
   - Implement proper process management for development server
   - Add pre-commit hooks for automated backups

2. **Short-term Improvements**
   - Implement backup verification
   - Add backup compression
   - Create backup restore testing procedures

3. **Long-term Goals**
   - Implement continuous backup strategy
   - Create backup monitoring dashboard
   - Automate backup testing
