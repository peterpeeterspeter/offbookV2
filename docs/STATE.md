# State Management Documentation

## Overview

Our application uses a combination of server-side and client-side state management strategies, focusing on simplicity and performance.

## State Management Strategy

### Server-Side State

- Express middleware for handling API requests
- Environment variables for configuration
- Daily.co API integration state

### Client-Side State

- React Query for server state management
- React hooks for local component state
- URL state for routing

## Current Implementation

### API State

```typescript
// Server configuration state
const DAILY_API_KEY = process.env.VITE_DAILY_API_KEY;
const DAILY_DOMAIN = process.env.VITE_DAILY_DOMAIN;

// API response types
interface ActionResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: string;
}
```

### Room Management State

- Room creation/deletion through Express endpoints
- Error state handling for API operations
- Request validation state

## State Flow

1. Client makes request to Express middleware
2. Middleware validates request and environment state
3. Request processed through Daily.co API
4. Response state returned to client
5. Client updates UI based on response state

## Future Improvements

1. Implement proper state persistence
2. Add WebSocket state for real-time updates
3. Implement proper error state handling
4. Add loading states for async operations
