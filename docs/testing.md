# Testing Documentation

## Testing Strategy

Our testing approach follows a comprehensive strategy that includes:

1. **Unit Tests**

   - Using Vitest for test runner
   - Jest-DOM for DOM testing utilities
   - React Testing Library for component testing
   - Coverage tracking with @vitest/coverage-v8

2. **Test Setup**

   - Configuration in `vite.config.ts`
   - Test setup file at `src/test/setup.ts`
   - JSDOM environment for DOM simulation

3. **Current Test Coverage**

### API Tests

- Daily.co room creation and deletion endpoints
- Error handling for missing API keys
- Request validation

### Component Tests

- To be implemented for React components
- Will focus on user interactions and accessibility

### Integration Tests

- To be implemented for API integration
- Will test Daily.co API integration
- Server middleware integration tests

## Test Commands

```bash
# Run tests
npm run test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Future Improvements

1. Add component tests for all React components
2. Implement E2E tests using Playwright
3. Add integration tests for Daily.co API
4. Improve test coverage reporting
