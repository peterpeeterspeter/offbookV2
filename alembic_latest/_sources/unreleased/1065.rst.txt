    Fixed bug where the SQLite implementation of
    :meth:`.Operations.rename_table` would render an explicit schema name for
    both the old and new table name, which while is the standard ALTER syntax,
    is not accepted by SQLite's syntax which doesn't support a rename across
    schemas. In particular, the syntax issue would prevent batch mode from
    working for SQLite databases that made use of attached databases (which are
    treated as "schemas" in SQLAlchemy).
