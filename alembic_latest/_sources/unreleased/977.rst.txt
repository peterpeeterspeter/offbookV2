    Fixed bug where an alter_column() operation would change a "NOT NULL"
    column to "NULL" by emitting an ALTER COLUMN statement that did not specify
    "NOT NULL". (In the absence of "NOT NULL" T-SQL was implicitly assuming
    "NULL"). An alter_column() operation that specifies `type_=` should also
    specify either `nullable=` or `existing_nullable=` to inform Alembic as to
    whether the emitted DDL should include "NULL" or "NOT NULL"; a warning is
    now emitted if this is missing under this scenario.
