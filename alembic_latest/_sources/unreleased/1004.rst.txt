    Fixed issue where using :meth:`.Operations.create_table` in conjunction
    with a :class:`.CheckConstraint` that referred to table-bound
    :class:`.Column` objects rather than string expressions would be added to
    the parent table twice, resulting in an incorrect DDL sequence. Pull
    request courtesy Nicolas CANIART.
