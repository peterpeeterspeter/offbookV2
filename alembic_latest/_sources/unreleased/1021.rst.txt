    Added an error raise for the condition where
    :meth:`.Operations.batch_alter_table` is used in ``--sql`` mode, where the
    operation requires table reflection, as is the case when running against
    SQLite without giving it a fixed ``Table`` object. Previously the operation
    would fail with an internal error.   To get a "move and copy" batch
    operation as a SQL script without connecting to a database,
    a ``Table`` object should be passed to the
    :paramref:`.Operations.batch_alter_table.copy_from` parameter so that
    reflection may be skipped.
