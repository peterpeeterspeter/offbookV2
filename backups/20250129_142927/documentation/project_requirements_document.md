1. Project Overview
Objective: Build an AI-powered SaaS platform for actors to practice scripts with a responsive virtual co-actor, offering emotion-aware interactions, adaptive timing, and real-time collaboration.

Key Innovations:

AI Co-Actor: Reads lines with emotional nuance, adjusts pacing based on user performance.

Smart Script Analysis: Auto-detects roles, scenes, and emotional cues.

Cost Efficiency: Cached audio, offline speech recognition, and scalable infrastructure.

Success Metrics:

User retention > 70% (measured via dashboard activity).

Average session latency < 1.5s.

API cost reduction by 80% via caching/optimization.

2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope
In-Scope	Out-of-Scope
✅ Emotion-aware TTS (ElevenLabs + DeepSeek NLP)	❌ Multi-language/regional voice support (v2)
✅ Adaptive response timing (user hesitation detection)	❌ Dedicated mobile app (web-first)
✅ Real-time script collaboration (role-based permissions)	❌ Advanced analytics dashboard (v2)
✅ Offline speech recognition (Whisper Tiny on-device)	❌ Third-party platform integrations
3. User Flow
Upload Script: PDF/Word → Auto-parse roles/scenes (DeepSeek).

Choose Mode:

Line-by-Line: AI highlights emotional cues (e.g., [angry]).

Scene Flow: AI adjusts pauses dynamically (e.g., +0.5s if user hesitates).

Cue Practice: Real-time feedback on timing accuracy.

Collaborate: Share script → Assign roles (view/edit permissions).

Review: Annotate scripts, replay sessions, export audio.

4. Core Features
AI Co-Actor:

Reads lines with emotion (ElevenLabs + DeepSeek emotion tags).

Adapts speed/pauses based on user performance (e.g., slower if user struggles).

Script Intelligence:

Role/scene detection (DeepSeek NLP).

Auto-tagging of emotional cues (e.g., [sarcastic], [whispering]).

Cost Optimization:

TTS audio caching (reuse frequent lines like "No way!").

Offline Whisper Tiny for speech-to-text (no cloud costs).

5. Advanced AI Features
Feature	Tech Stack	Impact
Emotion Detection	DeepSeek NLP + ElevenLabs	Adds nuance to AI delivery (e.g., angry vs. calm tone).
Dynamic Timing	Whisper STT + Custom Logic	Adjusts AI pauses based on user’s speech cadence.
Collaborative Rehearsal	Supabase Realtime + WebSocket	Syncs script edits/feedback across users in real-time.
6. Tech Stack & Tools
Frontend: React (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, WebSocket for real-time updates.

Backend: FastAPI (Python), JWT auth, Supabase Realtime DB.

AI Stack:

ElevenLabs (TTS with emotion modulation).

OpenAI Whisper Tiny (offline STT).

DeepSeek (NLP for script parsing/emotion tagging).

Infra: AWS Lambda@Edge (low-latency TTS), Redis (audio cache).

7. Non-Functional Requirements
Latency: AI response < 1.5s (via edge computing + streaming TTS).

Cost: TTS API costs reduced by 80% (caching + batch processing).

Security: GDPR compliance, end-to-end encryption for script data.

8. Cost Management & Optimization
TTS Caching: Store frequently used lines (e.g., "You’re crazy!") → 90% cost reduction.

Offline STT: Whisper Tiny on-device → $0 cloud costs.

Batch Processing: Pre-generate AI lines for static scripts overnight.

9. Constraints & Assumptions
Dependencies: ElevenLabs/Whisper API stability; fallback to cached audio if APIs fail.

Device Assumptions: Users have modern browsers/devices for offline Whisper.

10. Known Issues & Mitigations
Risk	Mitigation
High TTS costs for heavy users	Free tier limits + premium plans for unlimited access.
Whisper inaccuracies in noisy environments	UI prompt to “re-speak unclear lines.”
Real-time collaboration latency	WebSocket optimization + local echo for edits.
